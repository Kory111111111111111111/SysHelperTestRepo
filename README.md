# SysHelperTestRepo
This repository holds the Prelease Alpha of SysHelper. Many Parts of the app are simply placeholders until I get around to full implementation.

# What works Right Now

- Battery Management
- Storage Management is mostly implemented. Just fighting with Permissions at this point.
- There is no app icon, it uses the default icon for now until I can afford to pay someone to design one.
